# The Testing Grounds

## A game designed to test the player's knowledge of useless literature and film trivia.
* The game is played entirely with the mouse and the questions will be based on one of two pre-determined themes selected by the player at the start (Literature and Film). 
* Each one has ten questions with four possible answers. 
* The player's score will be displayed at the end.
* Future updates to the game have added a hint button as well. Clicking it will reveal a hint or additional trivia that will help the user narrow down the answer. U

* Clicking this button will have no impact on the player's score but the number of times the button was used will be displayed at the end along with their score. 


# Technologies
* The game was written mostly with Javascript but also utilizes html and CSS for the user experience and design. 
* A later update converted most of the CSS to SCSS and also gave me an opportunity to slightly improve the stylization. 

# Technical Information
* The program is written in vanilla javascript. 
* Code for both sections is contained within the appropriately named js files. 
* For ease of reading answers and questions should be written in the sections indicated by the comments.

# Issues
I ran into issues with stylization. I was unable to make my custom borders work and wound up settling for some of the default border types available for CSS and there was not enough time at the end for me to do anything particularly interesting with the aesthetics. In hindsight I probably should have spent more time planning the layout of my game. Because I knew the actual programming with Javascript would be the hardest part I did not consider the amount of time customizing the layout and optimizing the site for mobile players would require. This project also showed me the importance of class and id selectors. Future updates will aim to further improve the visuals.

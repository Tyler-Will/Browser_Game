A simple trivia game that I made to test my understanding of Javascript and the DOM. I chose a trivia game because I initially wanted to do a text adventure but that seemedto ambitious for the alloted time. The game is played entirely with the mouse and the questions will be based on one of two themes chosen by the player at the start. Each one has ten questions with four possible answers. The player's score is displayed at the end. The game was written mostly with Javascript but also utilizes html and CSS for the user experience and design.

I have not encountered any bugs but far more can still be done with the presentation.

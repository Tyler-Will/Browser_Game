A simple trivia game that I made to test my understanding of Javascript and the DOM. I chose a trivia game because I initially wanted to do a text adventure but that seemed too ambitious for the alloted time. The game is played entirely with the mouse and the questions will be based on one of two themes chosen by the player at the start. Each one has ten questions with four possible answers. The player's score is displayed at the end. The game was written mostly with Javascript but also utilizes html and CSS for the user experience and design.

I ran into issues with stylization. I was unable to make my custom borders work and wound up settling for some of the default border types available for CSS and there was not enough time at the end for me to do anything particularly interesting with the aesthetics. In hindsight I probably should have spent more time planning the layout of my game. Because I knew the actual programming with Javascript would be the hardest part I did not consider the amount of time customizing the layout and optimizing the site for mobile players would require. This project also showed me the importance of class and id selectors.

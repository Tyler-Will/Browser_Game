- From a functional standpoint the game is essentially done. Most if not all work henceforth will be dedicated to CSS and any minor bugs I encounter.
- litLogic code was more reusable than initially  assumed but index.html needed to be altered. Topic for popLogic  was narrowed down to film. Process was otherwise easier than expected.
- gameAnswers bug squashed. Will now move on to Pop Culture section. I might abandon that section to focus solely on CSS if I am unable to meet the deadline.
